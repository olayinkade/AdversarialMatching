# AdversarialMatching

# Abstract 
Trading on the darknet market provides privacy for both vendors and consumers looking to buy and sell illegal items. 
The idea of anonymity which is achieved using The Onion Router(TOR), an encrypted network, has brought about
tremendous growth to the market as vendors and consumers alike feel protected from agencies that might take interest 
in tracing them. This paper takes an in-depth look into the products sold on the network and also analyzes the seller 
on the darknet marketplace. In addition, we propose and design a system that performs single and multi market analysis.
In single market analysis, we identify all the addresses that can possibly belong to a vendor, while in multi market
analysis, we try to probabilistically match users across multi market darknet marketplaces.
